# Google Cloud Vision API demo using Dart gRPC

## Running

Set up a project on Google Cloud, enable the Cloud Vision API, and generate an API key for the project.

Place the API key in a file called `api.key`.

Run the demo: `dart bin/client.dart`.

## Regenerating gRPC stubs

To regenerate stubs, use tool/regenerate.sh. You will need a clone of googleapis/googleapis.
